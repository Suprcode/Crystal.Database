Guild territory is an exclusive space for a guild,
where the members stay for privacy. Members of the
guild that has its own territory do not have
to have secret meeting at the hidden corners of villages,
where privacy is still not guaranteed. Guild members may
have private conversations and socialize with other members.
In short, it is a residence for clans.

You need 10,000,000 {Gold/Gold} to rent a guild territory and the initial
period for rent is 7 days.
If you want to extend, talk to the 'GT Steward' in the territory.
After paying the fee of 1,000,000 {Gold/Gold},
the rent will be extended for an additional 7 days.
 
Do you still want to rent a territory? <Rent/@agitreg> <Cancel/@exit>

#SAY
Then I will teleport you to the territory of you guild.
However, only the guild masters or the members who
have their own territories can be transported.
If you wish to return to castles or villages, look
for the Armed Transporter at the entrance of the
guild territory.

Here, you can see all the information about ownership, trades,
and sales of guild territories at once. If you intend to
purchase a guild territory from the list, send a 'note'
to the guild master who owns the territory. And if you wish to
purchase the guild territory after reaching agreement,
use the 'trade' menu of the main screen.

#SAY
By facing the guild master and selecting 'trade',
the transaction is complete. After a successful transaction,
the ownership is transferred in 24 hours and the previous owners
are automatically 'kicked out' from the territory.
So, please think carefully berfore trading the guild territory.
